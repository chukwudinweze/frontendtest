# frontendtest

A task was assigned to retrieve the Swapi API and design it according to the instructions and mockup that were provided.

You must enter a valid email address and a password of at least 8 characters on the Auth page, which is the first 
page before reaching the Overview page. Formik and yup were used to authenticate. The imput element was made of the material ui.

The overview page and other pages were desined using only vanilla CSS.
